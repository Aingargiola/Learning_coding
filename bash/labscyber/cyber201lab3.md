# Issue tracking system
# Overview
- Issue tracking systems are a useful way to manage and resolve a technical workload as part of routine service desk operations. Today you’ll work with your first .ova scenario file. This exercise will expose you to common Windows problems and challenge you to document the problems in the Spiceworks ticketing system.
# Scenario
- Bob Jackson, a company sales lead, contacted you by phone to let you know he’s unable to access his report file on his desktop. “It keeps saying Paint won’t open, something like that. Then when I go to launch Apache OpenOffice through the desktop shortcut, it just opens a confusing menu instead of launching the text editor program that I need to edit the report file. It’s on my desktop, can you help? I’m going to lunch, so I’ll just check with you when I’m back.”
# Objectives
- Help Bob resolve the technical issues on his Windows 10 PC.
- Repair the computer so that Bob can open tps-report0442 from his user profile on his desktop with Apache OpenOffice suite.
- Create a shortcut to the Apache Word Processor on Bob’s desktop.
- If you changed any settings, notify Bob via Spiceworks.
- Complete a Spiceworks ticket from inception to resolution.

# Tasks
# Part 1: Staging
- Many labs in the Ops program utilize pre-configured VMs. For today’s lab, you’ll need to pull down an .ova file and import it.
- Download https://drive.google.com/file/d/14HTsFUG7eNGeI15wwCTj3-y3lcezAd3N/view?usp=drive_link


- Import ops201-class03.ova into your lab PC VirtualBox Manager.
- Review its system resource allocation, then launch ops201-class03.ova.
# Part 2: Issue Tracking and Resolution with Spiceworks
- If you completed prework, you should already have a Spiceworks account.
- For this portion of the lab, complete all documentation in the Spiceworks ticketing system. As you take steps to resolve the problems, make note in the corresponding ticket. All relevant pictures you take along the way should be uploaded and attached to the ticket as well.
- Once you have resolved a problem, take thorough screenshots of the ticket you created in Spiceworks and include those screenshots in your lab write-up. You can include any extra commentary or explanation you think would be helpful, but it is not required.
- Access the Help Desk on Spiceworks cloud.
- Create a ticket in Spiceworks. Describe Bob’s problem.
- Users love to ask for help on multiple issues in the same call or ticket. How will you track these issues?
- Assign the ticket to yourself.
- Troubleshoot and resolve the issue on Bob’s computer (ops201-class03.ova) with the admin credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: solarwinds123
- You might need to login as Bob (not admin) on his machine to attempt to recreate the issue. It’s OK to change any of Bob’s settings, including his password. He’s taken a lunch break to let you work on his computer!
- On the ticket, thoroughly document all operations performed to resolve the problem. Include as many technical details and screenshots as necessary to thoroughly illustrate the actions taken.
- When you have resolved the ticket and documented all actions taken, close the ticket.
# Wrapup
- When you’re finished with today’s lab assignment, delete ops201-class03 VM from VirtualBox Manager and also delete the .ova file you downloaded.
