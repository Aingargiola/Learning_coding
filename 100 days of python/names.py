# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:

# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 

# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 

# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
