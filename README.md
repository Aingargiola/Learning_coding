# teaching-code
 This repository is all about teaching some of the students base code in the bash and python enviroment
I will try to add descriptive comments to all the code to make it easier to understand and digest to people just learning.
I am not a coding expert just a hobby i enjoyed and a skill i teach to my cyber security boot camp.
